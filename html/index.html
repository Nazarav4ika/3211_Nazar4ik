                            The ninth film was originally scheduled by
                            Universal Pictures for April 19, 2019, but was
                            delayed several times, first due to the release
                            of The Fast and the Furious: Hobbs & Shaw (2019)
                            and Eon Productions' planned No Time to Die
                            (2021), and then due to the COVID-19
                            pandemic[7][8][9]. The film premiered in South
                            Korea and released internationally on May 19,
                            2021; In the USA, the film was released on June
                            25[10]. The film received mostly mixed reviews
                            from critics, with some praising Lean's stunts
                            and direction, while the film was criticized for
                            its unrealistic action sequences, lack of plot,
                            and revisiting of tropes.

                <h3>Fast and Furious 9</h3>
                <p>
                    Fast and Furious 9 (eng. F9) is a 2021 American action
                    film directed by Justin Lin and written by Lin and
                    Daniel Casey[6]. Sequel to the film "Fast and Furious 8"
                    (2017), the ninth main part and tenth full-length film
                    in the "Fast and Furious" media franchise. The film
                    stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Michelle Rodriguez,
                    Tyrese Gibson, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, John Cena,
                    Nathalie Emmanuel, Kurt Russell, Charlize Theron, Tju
                    Ørsted Ramussen and Anna Sawai. In the film, Toretto and
                    his team team up to stop a worldwide conspiracy led by
                    his younger brother Jacob (Cena). The beginning of the film shows the scene of the backstory that
                    Dominic tells Brian O'Connor in the first film:

                    1989 year. NASCAR racing. At the pit stop, Dominic (Vinny Bennett), a young man, warns his father,
                    Jack Toretto, about puddles of oil on the track. As the cars enter the final lap, driver Kenny
                    Linder (Jim Perrack), who doesn't like that Toretto will be in the next season and Linder himself is
                    not, begins to act aggressively on the road. Jack successfully lures Linder into a puddle of oil,
                    which makes the latter fly even more. He rear-ends Jack's car, causing Toretto to lose control; the
                    car, turning over, crashes into the fence at full speed and catches fire. The father dies on the
                    spot.
                    Several years have passed since Dominic's team defeated the cybercriminal Cypher (Charlize Theron).
                    Dominic (Vin Diesel), along with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and his grown-up son Brian, live in the
                    countryside, away from the bustle of the city. Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris)
                    and Ramsay (Nathalie Emmanuel) come to the heroes. They picked up a distress call from Mr. Nobody
                    (Kurt Russell), reporting a traitorous agent and some kind of “valuable cargo.” Ramsay adds that the
                    plane from which the signal was sent was transporting the captured Cypher and was attacked from the
                    air, and she was helped to escape.
                    The plane is believed to have crashed somewhere in the northwestern part of Montequinto. The team
                    decides to find Mister Nobody, a possible survivor of the crash, but Dominic refuses, as he decided
                    to retire from such activities to be with his son. The novel recalls that Cypher killed Elena
                    Nieves, Brian's biological mother. Toretto leaves anyway, saying that everything is in the past.
                    Before going to bed, Letty gives Brian the cross that Dominic once gave her, and leaves to join Tej,
                    Roman and Ramsay at the air base, since a quiet life is not to her taste. In his garage, Dom watches
                    a videotape in which he notices the family's cross.Toretto is on the neck of Mr. Nobody's attacker
                    and realizes that the attacker is his younger brother Jacob (John Cena). Dominic decides to fly to
                    Montequinto with the others.
